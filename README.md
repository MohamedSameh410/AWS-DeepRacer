# AWS-DeepRacer
Welcome to my AWS DeepRacer repository. This repo showcases my experiment that ranked among the **top 10** in **Egypt_DR_Jan25**. My model achieved a qualifying time of **8.4 seconds** with **0 off-tracks**, demonstrating strong performance in autonomous racing.

This repository includes my approach, training strategy, and key optimizations that contributed to this result.
## About AWS DeepRacer
[AWS DeepRacer](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/) is a cloud-based autonomous racing platform that helps developers learn reinforcement learning (RL) through hands-on experience. It provides a **1/18th scale autonomous car**, a **3D racing simulator**, and a **global competition** where participants train RL models to navigate virtual tracks efficiently.

DeepRacer allows users to experiment with different reward functions, hyperparameters, and training strategies to improve their model’s performance. The platform supports **sim-to-real transfer**, enabling trained models to run on physical DeepRacer cars.

Competitions are held at **AWS DeepRacer League** events, where participants compete for the fastest lap times while minimizing penalties like off-tracks and collisions.
